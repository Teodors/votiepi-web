### What is this?
A very simple SPA voting system for conferences and other alike events. Simply click on one of 3 faces (happy, whatever, bad) to vote. Vote is registered with Node.js in back-end and shown real-time with Socket.IO. 

### Getting started
Just run `node install` to get dependencies and then `node index.js` to start.

### Features
